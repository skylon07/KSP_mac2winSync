PreciseNode for Kerbal Space Program

Provides a more precise widget for maneuver node editing.  Whenever the map view is open and a maneuver node exists for the currently active vessel, the PreciseNode window will show.  You can edit the time that the maneuver will take place, edit prograde, radial, and normal vector magnitudes, see the final delta-V required for the maneuver, and also see the ejection angle of the maneuver from the orbited body.  This makes the mod excellent for use with porkchop plots that require precision burns.  PreciseNode allows you to change the conics drawing mode for better maneuver planning.  You can also control the PreciseNode widget from user-configurable keyboard shortcuts.
