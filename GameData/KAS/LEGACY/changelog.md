### 0.4.6 (16 February 2014)
- Parts can now be rotated around three axes while being attached. The default key bindings still rotate around the Z axis. Hold left alt to instead rotate around the X axis, and hold right alt for the Y axis.
- Part state is now preserved when parts are stored in containers. This means resource levels are stored as expected, and properties like whether solar panels have broken are also preserved. The mass of the container takes stored resource mass into account. Note that part statefulness must be enabled in the grab module config.
- Modules on parts retrieved from containers are now properly initialized. This means that, for example, solar panels will function properly when attached without reloading the scene.
- Containers are now opened through a context menu when in the editor.
- The small three-rung ladder can now be grabbed and stored.
- The medium dish antenna can now be grabbed and stored.
- Winch heads are now properly dropped when boarding a vessel.
- Tweaked rover wheel placement when held on EVA.

- Fixed an issue where pipe colliders would exist transiently. This removes the small camera jump when linking pipes, and it may prevent spontaneous base explosions.
- Fixed an issue where unlinking a pipe cycle would break things.
- The control state of the largest vessel is preserved when two vessels are connected.
- Fixed an issue where an internal position for grabbed parts would get stuck on a bad value.
- Fixed an issue where ladder parts were improperly initialized.
- Fixed an issue where KAS would instantiate parts with the wrong size.
- Fixed an issue where vessel control state could be reset when locking or unlocking a winch piece.
- Fixed an issue where a vessel's rigidbody could be in the wrong position after being on rails.
- Fixed an issue where attach parts like struts and pipes would not reattach on vessel load if they were not active (staged).
- Part names are no longer modified when parts are instantiated by KAS.
- Docked state is now symmetric (both modules know they are docked) and redundant docking events have been removed.
- Reduced the performance overhead of the grab module.
- Struts, pipes and winches now clean themselves up on part destruction.
- Keystrokes are ignored while an edit field is active.
- Unlocking winches now works with any joint type.
- Fixed an ID conflict between the winch and container windows.
