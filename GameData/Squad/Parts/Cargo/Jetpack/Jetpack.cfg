	description = #autoLOC_8003421 //#autoLOC_8003421 = The EVA jetpack has been a workhorse of kerbal astronauts for decades. It has been so useful that some kerbals have taken to wearing them inside the complex, back home, and even in their showers.\n\nIt gives unparalleled mobility in space and low gravity environments but can be tricky to master. Incidences of injury while using one have dropped to nearly 10% after sufficient training.
