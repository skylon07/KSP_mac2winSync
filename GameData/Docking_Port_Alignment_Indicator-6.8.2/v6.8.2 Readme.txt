          DPAI can be forced to place its button on the Stock App Launcher via a config file (see bundled Readme.txt)

[change]  DPAI can now be displayed without target selected. Use stock toolbar button to show/hide indicator
[added]   Setting to enable/disable cycling and automatic targeting of ports on target vessel (default: enabled)

[change] Text now drawn using Bitmap Fonts, allowing for higher resolution text.
[fixed] Indicator no longer displayed in Map View or while on EVA

Version 2.1:
[fixed] A bug that caused the velocity vector to behave incorrectly in certain circumstances [thanks Mr Shifty].
[fixed] CVEL now measures velocity along the target port's normal vector (intended behavior), not true velocity.
[fixed] Negated CVEL value when passing into back-hemisphere (red CDI region). Closure is now always a positive value.
[change] Velocity Indicator now draws on top of of Alignment Vector.
[change] Reduced sensitivity of alignment indicator near center of the gauge slightly.
[change] Removed forward velocity component of the velocity vector. Now full deflection always indicates 3.5 m/s of lateral velocity.
[change] Added slight exponential scaling to velocity vector near center of gauge.
[change] Velocity Indicator will display as a 'retrograde' vector when your alignment is greater than 90 degrees off-axis, indicating that translation controls have a reversed impact on the movement of the visual indicator. Moving the indicator towards the green cross will still bring you towards centerline.


Version 2.0:
[added] Course Deviation Indicators (CDI)
[added] Translational Velocity vector
[added] Closure velocity and distance readouts
[added] settings menu

This mod uses MiniAVC (https://github.com/CYBUTEK/KSPAddonVersionChecker) to provide automatic
version checking. If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version 
available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent. For a more 
comprehensive version checking experience, please download the full KSP-AVC Plugin.

This mod is packed with and requires the use of Module Manager in order to provide renamable 
docking ports as well as RPM integration. (https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager)
