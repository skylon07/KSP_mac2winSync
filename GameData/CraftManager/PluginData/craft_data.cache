		description = The Mallard is a large seaplane with twin high-efficiency turbofans mounted high on the fuselage to clear the spray. It is somewhat slow but very steady in flight. A full suite of flaps on the trailing edges of the main wings give it exceptional low-speed lift, and small hydroplane steps mounted on each side of the fuselage bottom help lift it out of the water (lowering water drag) during takeoff runs. Its entire fuselage, absent the cockpit forward, is one long cargobay, with a ramp at the tail end. This allows rovers (and boats) to come aboard or leave while the Mallard is landed. It's a bit low on fuel, so you might consider adding some to the cargo bay for long flights, or make them at high altitude.

The afterburning Panther turbofan provides high efficiency in dry mode and high thrust in wet mode, perfect for strolls and sprints both.¨¨The outriggers have a hydroplane stretching between them, allowing the Osprey to "step up" during its takeoff run in the water, massively lowering drag. Once you step up, it's safe to take off. The outriggers are jettisonable, but they have the landing gear too. So don't stage away the outriggers unless you're planning one final water landing, however (or one very final indeed land "landing").

		description = The Dynawing is a partially-reusable shuttle based around the Dynawing orbiter (with two KS25 engines) and an external tank to feed them, boosted by two Kickbacks. Hailed as the "next generation" of cheap access to space, with a payload of up to 16 tons (reference payload included), it is somewhat tricky to fly, as expensive as conventional rockets, and Kraken help you if something explodes on ascent. But it looks great, very futuristic. Flight crews are, of course, queuing up.¨¨The main engines fire roughly through the center of mass. Fly an inverted ascent with the shuttle on the 'down' side of the stack, and lead the prograde vector a bit. It's designed to use up all External Tank propellant on the first burn, horizontal by 45 km and keep burning to end up in a 75 x 0 km "orbit" or so. Then stage away  the tank, press 6 to disable the main engines, stage again to ignite the OMS engines, and use them to circularize and later deorbit. Fly a high-AoA reentry with RCS control.
