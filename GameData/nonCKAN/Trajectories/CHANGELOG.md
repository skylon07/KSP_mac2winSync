## v2.1.0 for KSP 1.4.1
 - 2018-03-21

### Changes since the last release

 * Trajectories license has been changed from MIT to GPL-3.0-or-later. Please see the LICENSE.md file for more details.
 * Russian translation updated. Many thanks to Fat-Zer for correcting the mistakes.
 * Chinese translation updated. Many thanks to studentmain for rewriting the translation.
 * Added Japanese, German, French, Italian and Portuguese languages. If you know any of these languages,
   please consider helping out with translations.
 * A big cheers and a beer to Jebs_SY for his help in fixing a rendering issue on the MapView and the Target Waypoint bug.
 * ModuleManager updated to v3.0.6
 
### For Developers

### Known Issues

 * Sometimes In-Flight trajectory ground target marker can cover entire screen when camera is close.


## v2.0.0 for KSP 1.3.1
 - 2018-02-15

### Changes since the last release

 * Completely new and overhauled user interface, based on the DialogGUI system.
   Includes (automated) localizations for Russian, Spanish and Chinese (traditional). If you know any of these languages,
   please consider helping out with translations. Send all Thanks and Kudos to PiezPiedPy for this amazing contribution!
 * In-Flight trajectory vector line and ground marker persistence bug fixed.
 * ModuleManager updated to v3.0.3
 * When combined with FAR, aerodynamic forces calculated on a packed vessel would lead to NRE's.
   Vessels are now no longer calculated when a vessel is in a packed state. Thanks go to Alex Wang for this bug fix.
 * Higher precision and better performance through more advanced numeric techniques using an RK4 integration method.
   Try disabling the Cache for more precise predictions, predictions that should not kill your FPS anymore.

### For Developers

 * API changes to help catch NRE's from improper calling of the API methods.
 * New API method `HasTarget()` checks if a target has been set.
 * Flickering entries bug in the Profiler is fixed :)
 * Added Reset averages & Show zero calls buttons, a Framerate limiter, avg calls and frame counter to the Profiler.
 
### Known Issues

 * Sometimes In-Flight trajectory ground target marker can cover entire screen when camera is close.


## v1.7.1 for KSP 1.3.1
 - 2017-10-13

### Changes since the last release

 * In-Flight trajectory overlay now uses GLUtils from MechJeb2 for rendering.

## v1.7.0 for KSP 1.3.0
 - 2017-07-08

### Changes since the last release

 * Improved precision by accounting for Reynolds number in drag. Fixes Issue #84.
 * Fix crash when turning on In-Flight trajectory display while in Map view. Fixes Issue #102. Thanks to PiezPiedPy!
 * Prevent click-through in certain situations. Thanks to PiezPiedPy!
 * Numbers in the user interface don't change as quickly anymore, allowing for better readability

### For Developers

 * Added a bridge to the newly created [Telemetry](https://github.com/fat-lobyte/KSPTelemetry) module,
   allowing for nice [graphs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/173609/27686194-febdbca6-5cd1-11e7-877d-1ab6e5069fb6.png)
   and better debugging of prediction precision.
 * Updated Profiler UI to new Canvas system. Thanks to PiezPiedPy!
 * Added documentation for contributers in CONTRIBUTING.md file with style guidelines,
   help for building, debugging and much more.

### Known Issues

  * In-Flight trajectory for non-atmospheric trajectories is incorrect and jumpy

- 2017-06-13

### Changes since the last release
  * Fixed in-flight targeting cross remaining in scene even after trajectory display was disabled.
  * Added toggle for in-flight trajectory display. Fixes Issue #96.

### Known Issues
