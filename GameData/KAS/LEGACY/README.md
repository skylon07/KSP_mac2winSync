KAS introduces new gameplay mechanics by adding winches, and EVA attachable struts/pipes. 
It gives some purpose to EVA and can be used for many things:

- Resource transfer
- Towing parts
- Base/vessel interconnections
- Vessel consolidation
- Cranes
- Airship anchoring
- Skycranes
- Elevators
- ...and more
